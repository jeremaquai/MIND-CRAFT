    At the current moment, this is just a small chat bot to play around and amuse yourself with.  This is my first attempt at a fully functional chat bot complete with a GUI. The concept is based on the coin operated Fortune Teller machines from my childhood with some of my own flare added into the mix.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage



MIND CRAFT is a fortune teller, so obviously you can ask it for a fortune and it will give you one. You may also ask for a lucky number and MIND CRAFT will give you a randomly generated number as your lucky numner. 

If you tell MIND CRAFT the year that you were born then it will respond with the Chinese Zodiac sign for the year that you were born in. If you tell MIND CRAFT your birthday in the Month Day format, it will reply to you with your astrological zodiac sign.

Once you have learned what your astrologica zodiac sign is, you can ask MIND CRAFT for either a monthy or yearly horoscope for your sign. MIND CRAFT was created and published in early July 2022 so these responses are hard coded into the bot and therefore may become dated without constant updating or a function that can keep the bot outomatically updated (a function that I currently lack the knowledge to write). 

As well as being able to get a horoscope for your astrological zodiac sign, you can ask MIND CRAFT for a personality profile of your sign to see how accurate it is.


All horoscopes and personality profiles were sourced from [Allure.com](Allure.com)
