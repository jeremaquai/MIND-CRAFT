=========
Welcome to MIND CRAFT, an interactive chatbot based on a fortune teller concept. \
You just simply need to ask a question or make a statement to proceed and recieve a reply.

Some example questions:
Exit or Quit
-will terminate and exit the program
Can a get a fortune?
-will reply with a random fortune
I was born in \{year of birth\}.
-Will reply with the Chinese zodiac sign for your year of birth
My birthday is \{month day\}
-Will reply with your astrological zodiac sign
What is the \{astrological sign\} sign?
-Will reply with a general description of the zodiac sign inquired about

There are also a few hidden responses to questions as easter eggs so just have fun and play around with the MIND CRAFT experiment.

In the near future MIND CRAFT will be able to respond to almost any question or statement that you enter just as if you were talking to another person and holding a conversation hopefully!
